/**
 * useImperativeHandle is a React Hook that lets you customize the handle exposed as a ref.
 * forwardRef API lets your component expose a DOM node to parent component with a ref.
 * By default, components donâ€™t expose their DOM nodes to parent components. 
 * hook in React allows a child component to expose certain functions or properties to its parent component, 
 * giving the parent component more control over the child component. 
 *  It's typically used in situations where a parent component needs to interact with a child component directly, such as for form validation or handling of user input. 
 * When compared to useRef, useImperativeHandle allows for more direct interaction with child components.
